## Gazebo simulation for NRF communication between drones and ground nodes.

### Introduction

In this project I have simulated communication between drone and ground nodes in an abstract way using publish subscriber messaging protocol. And also make decission to continue it's mission to next node or stay in the same node for retransmission if the transfered data is not in the acceptable level.
